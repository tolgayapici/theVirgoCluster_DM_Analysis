# the Virgo Cluster Dark Matter Analysis

## Dark Matter Annihilation and Decay Spectra

The dark matter spectra used in the analysis code are generated using PYTHIA8. These are the same spectra used in the following HAWC publication:
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01277>Dark Matter Limits From Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies with The HAWC Gamma-Ray Observatory</a>

## Spatial Templates

The spatial templates have been generated using CLUMPY with the parameters from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00004.pdf

## The results

The results of this analysis will be published in ApJ
